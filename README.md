## What is HiFight?

HiFight is a blog that captured the hype moments from fighting game tournaments and transform it to gfy format,
instead of watching 10 minutes++ long videos, you can enjoy some good moments in 15 seconds. 

Although, the description were written in Thai, 
I think the UI is friendly enough for anyone to navigate through the blog and find the content that they want.
When I have enough time, I want to expand this blog and write the description in English (and Japanese) too, someday...
